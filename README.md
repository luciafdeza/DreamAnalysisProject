## 1. Introduction

In our final project, we use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to study personal dream reports from a dataset of user-submitted information. The techniques that were used in this project are classification and clustering. 

For classification, we wanted to train a model capable of predicting the emotion associated with the dream. In clustering, we aimed to project the dreams and group them into clusters to try and find relations and patterns within the groups.

We also wanted to recommend similar dreams to users, as well as users who dream similar things. However, since dreams are a personal experience and it is impossible for two people to dream exactly the same thing, we were unable to recommend specific dreams.
